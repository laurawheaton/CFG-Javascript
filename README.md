Project name: Interactive Meal Planner

Project description:
The Interactive Meal Planner is a web-based tool with the aim to streamline meal planning. Users can explore four recipe options each for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and easily compile ingredients into a shopping list on a separate tab. This tool aims to save time and simplify the process of weekly meal preparation.

Features:
- Recipe Suggestions: Curated selection of four recipes for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) to offer variety and inspiration.
- Interactive Shopping List: Users can add ingredients from selected recipes to a shopping list, which is accessible on a separate tab.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design to make meal planning enjoyable and efficient.

How to Use:
1. Meal Selection: Browse through breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. Each meal category has four recipe choices.
2. Building a Shopping List: Browse the recipes ingredients and add chosen ingredients to the shopping list on a separate tab.
3. View and Manage Shopping List: On the shopping list tab, view and adjust the ingredient quantities as needed for your weekly shop.

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

Future improvements:
- Make the shopping list page interact directly with the recipe cards, allowing you to select the item and it automatically creates the shopping list, without having to manually add each item.
- Integrate the Edamam Recipe API to expand the recipe options for each meal group.
